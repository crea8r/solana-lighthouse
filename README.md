# Solana Program State Explain

## Motivation

Everything in Solana is an account, or put it in my word: everything in Solana is a file. If you are curious, then this is my presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fk5Uta5uraNlo3CR7M2KVWWiGN7w0X5hCwJJPtrYXtc/) for more detail. This small dapp help you explore PDA that an `anchor` program owns.

## Setup

There are two environment variables in `.env` to set:

- VITE_APP_MAINNET
- VITE_APP_DEVNET

Then you are good to go.

## Future development

Support different version of anchor, currently this works OK with `v0.30.0`.

What else? I have no idea. Make a PR and tell me what you think.

## Contribution
